# Project-Destroyer, provides you a best script hub
Designed for a good free script hub. As for the credits, thanks to few of the creator has their script and helped everyone out and me on this project (on the script)

It was made by solo developer posterRetarded64#0870 (poster) and designed to use KAVO ui lib

Created around Janurary 28th 2022 and was a inpopular community and tries my best to let people know our script much as possible!
# Scripts
How much does it cost? Is free!

Does it works on almost all executor? Yes!

Script has a universal hub and include a lot of games! (+5 free games for now)

Providing fast and easy to use hub and less slowdown with most necessary stuff if yeah..

# Possibly limited function
Most of API executor are keyless or possibly not enough functionability
We are HIGHLY STRICTED about user API
For example
```sethiddenproperty(game.Players.LocalPlayer, "SimulationRadius", 0) --supported sethiddenproperty
    game.Players.LocalPlayer.SimulationRadius = 0 --not supported sethiddenproperty
```
API interface are very important and required most of the functions you may never used
I will try to keep up script working as possible, but not effective as you seen
